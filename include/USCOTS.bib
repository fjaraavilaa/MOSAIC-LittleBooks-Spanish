@article{Benford38,
	abstract = {It has been observed that the first pages of a table of common
	  logarithms show more wear than do the last pages, indicating that more
		used numbers begin with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. A
		compilation of some 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent
		sources shows that there is a logarithmic distribution of first digits
		when the numbers are composed of four or more digits. An analysis of
		the numbers from different sources shows that the numbers taken from
		unrelated subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a much
		better agreement with a logarithmic distribution than do numbers from
		mathematical tabulations or other formal data. There is here the
		peculiar fact that numbers that individually are without relationship
		are, when considered in large groups, in good agreement with a
		distribution law-hence the name {"}Anomalous Numbers.{"} A further
		analysis of the data shows a strong tendency for bodies of numerical
		data to fall into geometric series. If the series is made up of numbers
		containing three or more digits the first digits form a logarithmic
		series. If the numbers contain only single digits the geometric
		relation still holds but the simple logarithmic relation no longer
		applies. An equation is given showing the frequencies of first digits
		in the different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10 to 100, etc. The
		equation also gives the frequency of digits in the second, third...
		place of a multi-digit number, and it is shown that the same law
		applies to reciprocals. There are many instances showing that the
		geometric series, or the logarithmic law, has long been recognized as a
		common phenomenon in factual literature and in the ordinary affairs of
		life. The wire gauge and drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude
		scale of the astronomer and the sensory response curves of the
		psychologist are all particular examples of a relationship that seems
		to extend to all human affairs. The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a
		general probability law of widespread application.},

@book{Knuth:art2,
	abstract = {{Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's classic series The Art of Computer
	  Programming covers seminumerical algorithms, with topics ranging from
		random number generators to floating point operations and other
		optimized arithmetic algorithms. Truly comprehensive and meticulously
		written, this book (and series) is that rarest of all creatures--a work
		of authoritative scholarship in classical computer science, but one
		that can be read and used profitably by virtually all working
		programmers.

The book begins with fundamental questions regarding random numbers and how to
use algorithms to generate them. Subsequent chapters demonstrate efficient
computation of single-precision and double-precision arithmetic calculations
and modular arithmetic. The text then presents prime factorization (which can
	be used in cryptography, for instance) and algorithms for calculating
fractions. This volume ends with algorithms for polynomial arithmetic and
manipulation of power-series topics, which will benefit those with some
knowledge of calculus.

Throughout this beautifully presented edition, Knuth incorporates hundreds of
useful exercises for trying out the algorithms. These range from simple
problems to larger research project topics. (The book provides answers, where
	appropriate, at the end of the book.) The result is a text that's suitable
for college or graduate-level computer science courses or individual study by
  programmers. Volume 2 is an indispensable part of any working programmer's
	library.}},

		 given form is performed by counting the number of observations falling
			 into specified cells and applying the chi-squared test to these
			 frequencies. In estimating the parameters for this test, one may
			 use the maximum likelihood (or equivalent) estimate based (1) on
			 the cell frequencies, or (2) on the original observations. This
			 paper shows that in (2), unlike the well known result for (1), the
			 test statistic does not have a limiting chi-squared-distribution, but that
			 it is stochastically larger than would be expected under the chi-squared
			 theory. The limiting distribution is obtained and some examples
			 are computed. These indicate that the error is not serious in the
			 case of fitting a Poisson distribution, but may be so for the
			 fitting of a normal.},

Obese women have lower family incomes than women whose weight-for-height is in the "recommended" range. Results for men are weaker and mixed. We find similar results when we compare same-sex siblings in order to control for family background (for example, social class) differences. Differences in economic status by body mass for women increase markedly when we use an earlier weight measure or restrict the sample to persons who were single and childless when the early weight was reported. There is some evidence of labor market discrimination against obese women. Differences in marriage probabilities and spouse's earnings, however, account for 50 to 95 percent of their lower economic status. There is little evidence that obese African American women suffer an economic penalty relative to other African American women.},

For the purposes of this article, SAT Verbal and SAT Mathematical scores were placed on recentered scales, which have reporting ranges of 920 to 980, means of 950, and standard deviations of 11. (The 920-to-980 scale is used in this article to highlight the distinction between it and the old 200-to-800 scale. In actuality, recentered scores were reported on a 200-to-800 scale.) Recentering was accomplished via a linear transformation of normally distributed scores that were obtained from a continuized, smoothed frequency distribution of original SAT scores that were originally on augmented two-digit scales (i.e., discrete scores rounded to either 0 or 5 in the third decimal place). These discrete scores were obtained for all students in the 1990 Reference Group using 35 different editions of the SAT spanning October 1988 to June 1990. The performance of this 1990 Reference Group on the original and recentered scales is described. The effects of recentering on scores of individuals and the 1990 Reference Group are also examined. Finally, recentering did not occur solely on the basis of its technical merit. Issues associated with converting recentering from a possibility into a reality are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Finland-United States Investigation Of NIDDM Genetics
		(FUSION) study aims to identify genetic variants that predispose to
			type 2 diabetes by studying affected sibling pair families from
			Finland. Chromosome 20 showed our strongest initial evidence for
			linkage. It currently has a maximum logarithm of odds (LOD) score
			of 2.48 at 70 cM in a set of 495 families. In this study, we
			searched for diabetes susceptibility variant(s) at 20q13 by
			genotyping single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in case and
			control DNA pools. Of 291 SNPs successfully typed in a 7.5-Mb
			interval, the strongest association confirmed by individual
			genotyping was with SNP rs2144908, located 1.3 kb downstream of the
			primary beta-cell promoter P2 of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha
			(HNF4A). This SNP showed association with diabetes disease status
			(odds ratio [OR] 1.33, 95\% CI 1.06-1.65, P = 0.011) and with
			several diabetes-related traits. Most of the evidence for linkage
			at 20q13 could be attributed to the families carrying the risk
			allele. We subsequently found nine additional associated SNPs
			spanning a 64-kb region, including the P2 and P1 promoters and
			exons 1-3. Our results and the independent observation of
			association of SNPs near the P2 promoter with diabetes in a
			separate study population of Ashkenazi Jewish origin suggests that
			variant(s) located near or within HNF4A increases susceptibility to
			type 2 diabetes.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a scientific model to explain the analysis
process. We argue that data analysis is primarily a procedure to build
understanding, and as such, it dovetails with the cognitive processes of the
human mind. Data analysis tasks closely resemble the cognitive process known as
sensemaking. We demonstrate how data analysis is a sensemaking task adapted to
use quantitative data. This identification highlights a universal structure
within data analysis activities and provides a foundation for a theory of data
analysis. The competing tensions of cognitive compatibility and scientific
rigour create a series of problems that characterise the data analysis process.
These problems form a useful organising model for the data analysis task while
allowing methods to remain flexible and situation dependent. The insights of
this model are especially helpful for consultants, applied statisticians and
teachers of data analysis.},

@book{Salsburg:2002,
    abstract = {{Science is inextricably linked with mathematics. Statistician David Salsburg examines the development of ever-more-powerful statistical methods for determining scientific truth in <I>The Lady Tasting Tea</I>, a series of historical and biographical sketches that illuminate without alienating the mathematically timid. Salsburg, who has worked in academia and industry and has met many of the major players he writes about, shares his subjects' enthusiasm for problem solving and deep thinking. His sense of excitement drives the prose, but never at the expense of the reader; if anything, the author has taken pains to eliminate esoterica and ephemera from his stories. This might frustrate a few number-head readers, but the abundant notes and references should keep them happy in the library for weeks after reading the book.<p>  Ultimately, the various tales herein are unified in a single theme: the conversion of science from observational natural history into rigorously defined statistical models of data collection and analysis. This process, usually only implicit in studies of scientific methods and history, is especially important now that we seem to be reaching the point of diminishing returns and are looking for new paradigms of scientific investigation. <I>The Lady Tasting Tea</I> will appeal to a broad audience of scientifically literate readers, reminding them of the humanity underlying the work.  <I>--Rob Lightner</I>} {At a summer tea party in Cambridge, England, a guest states that tea poured into milk tastes different from milk poured into tea. Her notion is shouted down by the scientific minds of the group. But one man, Ronald Fisher, proposes to scientifically test the hypothesis. There is no better person to conduct such an experiment, for Fisher is a pioneer in the field of statistics. The Lady Tasting Tea spotlights not only Fishers theories but also the revolutionary ideas of dozens of men and women which affect our modern everyday lives. Writing with verve and wit, David Salsburg traces breakthroughs ranging from the rise and fall of Karl Pearsons theories to the methods of quality control that rebuilt postwar Japans economy, including a pivotal early study on the capacity of a small beer cask at the Guinness brewing factory. Brimming with intriguing tidbits and colorful characters, The Lady Tasting Tea salutes the spirit of those who dared to look at the world in a new way.}},
